# dayPlanner
Making an application where one can write in events for a given day and save them locally.
The result is a tad rough around the edges, but I tried my hand at using Sass simply to expand my knowledge of design because I read that Sass was a valuable skill to have for UI/UX as it made writing cleaner, more stable/powerful CSS.
